        Parameters
        ----------
        convex : bool
                 When True, a non-convex linar combination of previous x_list records
                 is not allowed. If it occurs, the oldest record is removed from the
                 history and a new attempt is made. This is repeated until a convex
                 solution is found or until there is only one record left in the
                 history.
        downhill : bool
                   Only downhill moves are allowed with respect to the last record. In
                   case of a non-downhill move, the history is reduced. This only makes
                   sense if y_list contains the derivatives of an objective towards the
                   elements of x_list.
        cnmax : float
                The maximum allowed condition number of the DIIS matrix. If exceeded,\
                the history is reduced.
        validation : fn(*x_list) -> bool
                     A user provided function that checks the validity of an extrapolated
                     x_list. If invalid, the history is reduced.

        Returns
        -------
        new_x : list of np.ndarray or float
                An interpolation between previous x values in the history that should
                minimize the norm of y.
